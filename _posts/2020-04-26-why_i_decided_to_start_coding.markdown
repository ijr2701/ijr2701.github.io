    Hello my name is Isaiah! The reason I decided to start a coding school was because I wanted to become sucessful in life and do something I love doing! I first started coding when I was in high school. the reason is coding is now considered a foreign language in high school and if you have just started coding I'm sure you are seeing why it is considered a foreign language. Anyways back to my high school coding class, coding was a new class for my high school the year I took it when i first got into the class we were to learn the bacis of javascript at the beginning of the year after the first lesson i fell in love with it. We had this one task in class were we had to beat the game with nothing but coding it was pretty fun. then after that i knew what i wanted to do as for my career in life.
